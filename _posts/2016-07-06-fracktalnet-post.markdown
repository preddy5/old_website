## FractalNet

FractalNet is a neural network macro architecture based on self-similarity. You can read the paper on FractalNet [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07648).
Since most of the code is similar to that of [Residual-Learning-and-Stochastic-Depth](https://github.com/pradyu1993/Residual-Learning-and-Stochastic-Depth). I thought of not repeating the whole explaination you can refer to  [this post](http://pradyu1993.github.io/2016/06/06/resnet-post.html) for understanding what is happening in the code.


Total Code is available on
[Github](https://github.com/pradyu1993/fractalNet).
